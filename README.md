# Blender Object Creation Script

This repository contains a Python script to create a bunch of objects using Blender's Python API.

## Introduction

Blender is a powerful open-source 3D computer graphics software that offers a comprehensive set of tools for modeling, animation, rendering, and more. This repository contains a Python script that automates the process of creating a variety of 3D objects within the Blender environment. The script can be customized to create different types of objects with various properties, making it a useful tool for artists and developers working with Blender.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script to your local machine.

2. Open Blender.

3. In Blender, go to "Scripting" workspace.

4. Click on "Open" and select the downloaded `main_non_rigid_object_creation.py` file and also all other files in 'in_blender' file.

5. Press the "Run Script" button within 'main_non_rigid_object_creation.py' to execute the script.

## How It Works

The Python script uses Blender's Python API to interact with the 3D environment and create objects. It follows a structured process to generate a bunch of objects based on the specified parameters, such as object type, size, position, and materials. The script can be easily customized to create different types of objects or modify their attributes according to your needs.
